- reuse some code parts, for example:
	- zView should use zcodeclib, it has its own copy&pasted routines
	- things like zvdi, debug, general.h, memory in all projects
- convert zView to windom 2.x (zWeather is done in the latest revision)
- add right licenses, to zXXX code, plugins, libraries used by plugins, ...
