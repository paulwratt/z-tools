- PDF window: zView should always remember which zoom has been set when the
- next
or previous page is shown. At the moment, it displays a new page with 100%
- or
fitted to the window (last one if the option "Fit PDF to the window" is set)
regardless of the zoom set by the user beforehand via the zoom buttons.

- Keyboard shortcuts: a) It would be great to be able to use <Control>+<U>
- not
just for the browser and image windows but also for the options dialogues
- and
the PDF windows. b) Some more shortcuts:

All windows:
<Control> + <W> = changing windows

Browser and PDF window:
<Shift> + cursor up = page up
<Shift> + cursor down = page down
<ClrHome> = beginning of the page
<Shift> + <ClrHome> = end of the page

Browser window:
<Control> + <Backspace> = go back button (switches to the contents of the
directory above the present one)
<Esc> = update directory button
<+> = enlarge thumbnail size button
<-> = reduce thumbnail size button

Image windows:
<+> = enlarge picture size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce picture size button (zoom)
<*> = full screen button

PDF windows:
<+> = enlarge page size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce page size button (zoom)
<Control> + cursor right/up = next page button
<Control> + cursor left/down = previous page button
