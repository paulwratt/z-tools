- PDF window: zView should always remember which zoom has been set when the
next or previous page is shown. At the moment, it displays a new page with 100%
or fitted to the window (last one if the option "Fit PDF to the window" is set)
regardless of the zoom set by the user beforehand via the zoom buttons.
==============================================================================
- Keyboard shortcuts:
a) It would be great to be able to use <Control>+<U>
not just for the browser and image windows but also for the options dialogues
and the PDF windows.

b) Some more shortcuts:

All windows:
<Control> + <W> = changing windows

Browser and PDF window:
<Shift> + cursor up = page up
<Shift> + cursor down = page down
<ClrHome> = beginning of the page
<Shift> + <ClrHome> = end of the page

Browser window:
<Control> + <Backspace> = go back button (switches to the contents of the
directory above the present one)
<Esc> = update directory button
<+> = enlarge thumbnail size button
<-> = reduce thumbnail size button

Image windows:
<+> = enlarge picture size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce picture size button (zoom)
<*> = full screen button

PDF windows:
<+> = enlarge page size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce page size button (zoom)
<Control> + cursor right/up = next page button
<Control> + cursor left/down = previous page button
==============================================================================
Latest news. zView doesn´t work under TOS with Enhancer.prg instead of NVDI
(crash while opening the browser) neither on the CT60 nor CT63. Lars tested it
on both machines. If I´m not mistaken, nothing else was installed. I´d suggest
you have a look at it. Try it on your Falcon under TOS. With some luck, this
problem is related to the one Ektus and me have under MagiC and TOS. I´m very
curious if you can reproduce this crash on your Falcon. If not, I´d like to buy
your machine ;-)
==============================================================================
And Ektus told me he got the impression that sometimes, after opening the
browser, the thumbnails were displayed only when he´d scrolled the browser
window. I told him he should keep an eye on it.
==============================================================================
b) You solved the umlauts bug in the navigation list. Works fine. Do you know if
there can also be such a bug for extended information (Exif and other metadata)?
It's rather a question then a bug report since haven't found a picture or PDF
with extended data and Umlauts so far.
--> wont fix
==============================================================================
d) If I browse the test TIFF images archive available from the LiBTIFF website
(http://libtiff.maptools.org/images.html), zView writes some warnings on the
screen. And do you know why many pictures in the folder Depth can´t be
displayed? For example, at least the 24-bit colour TIFF images shouldn´t be a
problem for a TIFF reader, should they?
==============================================================================
e) If the closer button of a picture window is above an icon of the browser
window's toolbar, the corresponding toolbar icon will be selected when the
picture window is closed by a mouse click on the closer.
==============================================================================
Here´s another picture file to be stored ;-) It´s a multi-page TIFF image and
has 8 pages/pictures. If I remember correctly, the latest zView says it has one
picture and zView BETA7 by Zorro says it has two (information dialogue -> Format
-> Pages). Of course, both are wrong.
==============================================================================
On the internet, I´ve found a PDF with an umlaut in the extended info:
Gründerwerkstatt.pdf. The "ü" is missing, instead another character is used.
