 * This file contains simple error-reporting and trace-message routines.
 * These are suitable for Unix-like systems and others where writing to
 * stderr is the right thing to do.  Many applications will want to replace
 * some or all of these routines.
 *
 * If you define USE_WINDOWS_MESSAGEBOX in jconfig.h or in the makefile,
 * you get a Windows-specific hack to display error messages in a dialog box.
 * It ain't much, but it beats dropping error messages into the bit bucket,
 * which is what happens to output to stderr under most Windows C compilers.
 *
 * These routines are used by both the compression and decompression code.
