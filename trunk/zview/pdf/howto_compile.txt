0. Download & install latest libfreetype2 (simple make & make install)
1. Download xpdf 3.02 + all 4 patch sets from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html
2. Go xpdf-3.02 directory
3. Apply patch sets: cat <download path>/xpdf-3.02pl1.patch | patch -p1 (for all 4 of them)
4. Apply zView patch: cat xpdf-3.02pl4-zview.patch | patch -p1
5. ./configure --host=m68k-atari-mint --with-freetype2-includes=/usr/m68k-atari-mint/include/freetype2 --without-x
6. make
7. Delete (or rename) this directory ('pdf') and rename your 'xpdf-3.02' to 'pdf'
  (and put it in the same location as old 'pdf' ofcourse!)

This will produce all needed libs and object files for zView.
