- reuse some code parts, for example:
	- zView should use zcodeclib, it has its own copy&pasted routines
	- things like zvdi, debug, general.h, memory in all projects
- convert zView to windom 2.x (zWeather is done in the latest revision but crashes)
- find out why zView crashes with memory protection (it kills desktop on start, by jpeg decoding, ...)
- include newest nfjpeg.prg (from aranym) and dspjpg (from Lonny's site) in _dist
- link ldg codecs with libraries and not use hard-placed C files (there are problems with clashes like uint8 etc)
- clean up zcodeclib + ldg plugins, now it's one big copy&pasted mess (see entry above)
- add right licenses, to zXXX code, plugins, libraries used by plugins, ...
- compile own mem.ldg, I've got very bad feeling about usage some old (maybe PureC-compiled?) code...
