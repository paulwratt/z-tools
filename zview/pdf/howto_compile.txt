0. Download & install latest libfreetype2 from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype (simple make & make install, I use -m68020-60 with CFLAGS)
1. Download xpdf 3.03 from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html
2. Go xpdf-3.03 directory
3. Apply zView patch: cat xpdf-3.03-zview.patch | patch -p1
4. ./configure --host=m68k-atari-mint --with-freetype2-includes=~/gnu-tools/m68k-atari-mint/include/freetype2 -with-freetype2-library=~/gnu-tools/m68k-atari-mint/lib/m68020-60 --without-x
5. make
6. Delete (or rename) this directory ('pdf') and rename your 'xpdf-3.03' to 'pdf'
  (and put it in the same location as old 'pdf' ofcourse!)

This will produce all needed libs and object files for zView.
