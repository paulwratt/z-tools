- PDF window: zView should always remember which zoom has been set when the
next or previous page is shown. At the moment, it displays a new page with 100%
or fitted to the window (last one if the option "Fit PDF to the window" is set)
regardless of the zoom set by the user beforehand via the zoom buttons.
==============================================================================
- Keyboard shortcuts:
a) It would be great to be able to use <Control>+<U>
not just for the browser and image windows but also for the options dialogues
and the PDF windows.

b) Some more shortcuts:

All windows:
<Control> + <W> = changing windows

Browser and PDF window:
<Shift> + cursor up = page up
<Shift> + cursor down = page down
<ClrHome> = beginning of the page
<Shift> + <ClrHome> = end of the page

Browser window:
<Control> + <Backspace> = go back button (switches to the contents of the
directory above the present one)
<Esc> = update directory button
<+> = enlarge thumbnail size button
<-> = reduce thumbnail size button

Image windows:
<+> = enlarge picture size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce picture size button (zoom)
<*> = full screen button

PDF windows:
<+> = enlarge page size button (zoom)
<-> = reduce page size button (zoom)
<Control> + cursor right/up = next page button
<Control> + cursor left/down = previous page button

Latest news. zView doesn´t work under TOS with Enhancer.prg instead of NVDI
(crash while opening the browser) neither on the CT60 nor CT63. Lars tested it
on both machines. If I´m not mistaken, nothing else was installed. I´d suggest
you have a look at it. Try it on your Falcon under TOS. With some luck, this
problem is related to the one Ektus and me have under MagiC and TOS. I´m very
curious if you can reproduce this crash on your Falcon. If not, I´d like to buy
your machine ;-)

And something different. Thanks for the "Show Unsupported Files" option. Very
good idea to rename the old one and show now always folders and PDF files. Those
"Show Non-Images" (menu) and "Show common files" (preference dialogue) options
were very irritating. Now it is much easier to understand.

What do think about the following additional idea? We rename the "Show common
files" option in the preference dialogue with "Show unsupported files" and
replace the new "Show Unsupported Files" in the menu with "Show Only Images". I
think this is the optimal solution. In the dialogue is the not-often-used option
(some like it to see all files, other don´t), and via the menu, one can list
quickly only images (i.e. no folders and any other files) in the browser.

Additionally, as discussed before, I renamed the menu entry "Show Unsupported
Files" by "Show Only Images", and "Show common files" in the preferences with
"Show unsupported files" (the button name is also renamed: SHOW_NON_IMAGES ->
SHOW_UNSUPPORTED_FILES, and therefore has to be changed everywhere in the code,
too, along with the code changes for the "new" option ;-)
==============================================================================
There is small problem with the progress bar in the deleting files dialogue.
It's one pixel too wide and high. For beta6 (7th August 2005), Zorro corrected
this for the read progress bar but apparently not for the delete bar. Would be
nice to have this corrected.
==============================================================================
And Ektus told me he got the impression that sometimes, after opening the
browser, the thumbnails were displayed only when he´d scrolled the browser
window. I told him he should keep an eye on it.

a) Write-protected files can be deleted with zView's delete function.
--> feature
==============================================================================
b) You solved the umlauts bug in the navigation list. Works fine. Do you know if
there can also be such a bug for extended information (Exif and other metadata)?
It's rather a question then a bug report since haven't found a picture or PDF
with extended data and Umlauts so far.
--> wont fix
==============================================================================
d) If I browse the test TIFF images archive available from the LiBTIFF website
(http://libtiff.maptools.org/images.html), zView writes some warnings on the
screen. And do you know why many pictures in the folder Depth can´t be
displayed? For example, at least the 24-bit colour TIFF images shouldn´t be a
problem for a TIFF reader, should they?
==============================================================================
e) If the closer button of a picture window is above an icon of the browser
window's toolbar, the corresponding toolbar icon will be selected when the
picture window is closed by a mouse click on the closer.
==============================================================================
Here´s another picture file to be stored ;-) It´s a multi-page TIFF image and
has 8 pages/pictures. If I remember correctly, the latest zView says it has one
picture and zView BETA7 by Zorro says it has two (information dialogue -> Format
-> Pages). Of course, both are wrong.
==============================================================================
On the internet, I´ve found a PDF with an umlaut in the extended info:
Gründerwerkstatt.pdf. The "ü" is missing, instead another character is used.
